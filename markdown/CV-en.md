#### Self Judgement

Coding , I'm seriously.

Good at learning, well this doesn't mean I'm new, that's means I have the passion in learning.
6 years experience, when I realize that I have waste too much time on tiny detail. I should be more
effictive. So I want to join a good company, that's the best in 
my eyes.
